outline of intended function

create a new spack site with the apps etc defined for the new period 
will need to read a use specs for that period (in a spack format yaml file)
will create that in a new spack site just for that
separate yaml file included for long term constant settings e.g. compiler
  (or put that in the period spec file???)
will need file for long term non spack paramters (.ini to avoid confusion with spack yaml files)
  - e.g. root directory for all period spack sites.
