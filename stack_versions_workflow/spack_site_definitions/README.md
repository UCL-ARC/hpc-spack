# This folder

Will contain one spack yaml file for each spack site created by the scipts, 
which will usually be one new site per period. Each file will contain 
all the spack specs for the entire spack site. The file may use 'include' 
to import more static paramters, such as the default comiler choice.

The stack maintaingers will each month take a copy of the last period's 
yaml file and add to it any new specs required.
